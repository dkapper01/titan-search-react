# H1 TitanSearch 2.0

TitanSearch 2.0 is a single page app made with React, Bootstrap, and Google Custom Search API. After the popularity of the original TitanSearch, I decided to make a better TitanSearch with my new understanding of what features were most important. The new TitanSearch has the ability to conduct multiple custom search without having to retype the name or the company. 

# H1 TitanSearch 1.0

TitanSearch 1.0 was made to help my co-worker at TitanHouse find top executives in the US and Canada. By searching the personâ€™s name and company in TitanSearch the app finds the the executives profiles on Linkedin and Bloomberg. TitanSearch increased productive at Titanhouse substantially. In just six months time it was used almost 40,000 times.
