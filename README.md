# TitanSearch 2.0

TitanSearch 2.0 is a single page web app made with React, Bootstrap, and Google Custom Search API. After the popularity of the original TitanSearch, I decided to make a more advanced TitanSearch.  TitanSearch was tens of thousands of times, so I had a good understanding of what features were useful and what features were not useful. The new TitanSearch can conduct multiple custom searches without having to retype the name or the company. It has multiple fields just for the name and company. It is requesting JSON object for better results and styling. 

## TitanSearch 1.0

TitanSearch 1.0 was made to help my co-worker at TitanHouse find top executives in the US and Canada. By searching the personâ€™s name and company in TitanSearch the app finds the the executives profiles on Linkedin and Bloomberg. TitanSearch increased productive at Titanhouse substantially. In just six months time it was used almost 40,000 times.
